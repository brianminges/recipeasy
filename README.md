# RecipEZ - a personal recipe database
A basic recipe storage app using only vanilla JavaScript. 

## General information
This is my first attempt at a working app after studying vanilla JavaScript in a coding bootcamp. It incorporates many of the areas of study, including fetch API, JSON, array methods, forms, event listeners and state.

## Technologies
- ES6
- HTML5
- CSS3

## Features
- Homepage background randomly rotates among five images each time it loads. 
- Five ways to search for a recipe: by type, by occassion, by type AND occasion, by name, by favorite.
- Each recipe can be edited, deleted or favorited/unfavorited.

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally. Serve from the src directory. Serve the json-server from the api directory. 

## Project status
Complete. 

## Room for improvement
- Display ingredients and steps as `<li>` elements.
- Add image upload functionality so a photo can be included with each recipe. 
- Add user authentication.
- Add ability to share recipes across users.
