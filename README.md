# RecipEZ: A personal recipe database
A basic recipe storage app using only vanilla JavaScript. 

## General information
This is my first attempt at a working app while studying software development at Nashville Software School. It uses only vanilla JavaScript and JSON-server while incorporating many areas of study, including fetch API, JSON, array methods, forms, event listeners and state.

## Technologies
- ES6
- HTML5
- CSS3
- DB Diagram

## Features
- Full CRUD capabilities.
- Homepage background randomly rotates among five images each time it loads. 
- Users can search for a rescipe five ways: by type, by occassion, by type AND occasion, by name, by favorite.
- Each recipe can be favorited/unfavorited. When favorited, the recipe card changes color. 

## Selected pages and features
